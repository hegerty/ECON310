# ECON310, Northeastern Illinois University

Here is a link to the tentative [Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mSVWJYid3GEor1Ikvewi9o4WidV-7kWb/view?usp=sharing). the course starts March 22, 2022 and runs for eight weeks.

<b>NEW!</b> I added some [notes](https://github.com/hegerty/ECON310/blob/main/ECON_310_Notes.pdf) that I will update as the course progresses.

Here is a [.pdf](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Proofreading-Marks.pdf) with some Proofreader's markings. I use many (but not all) of them in my work.

Here is some "review" material on basic statistics. These are also used in ECON 343 and/or 346.
